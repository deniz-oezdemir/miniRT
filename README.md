# 42-miniRT

BUGS:
1. if i move the camera in multiple directions (e.g -2,1,1) we get a segmentation fault
2. maybe stop at the firs intersection instead of calculating all of them

rendering time before optimization: 19 sec (img03.rt)


* Reference system (righ hand rule)

camera along x-axis
thumb: axis parallel to camera
index finger: z-axis
middle finger: y-axis


camera along y-axis
